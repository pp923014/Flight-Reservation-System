# ✈️ Flight Reservation System (C++ | Graph + Dijkstra’s Algorithm)

## 📌 Project Description  
The **Flight Reservation System** is a **C++ console-based application** that helps users find the shortest and cheapest flight routes between cities. It utilizes **Graphs** and **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** to determine the optimal path between cities based on flight costs. Users can **add cities, add flight routes, find the shortest route, and book flights**.

## 🚀 Features  
✔ **Graph Representation** - Models cities and flight routes using an **adjacency list**.  
✔ **Shortest Path Calculation** - Implements **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** to find the most cost-effective route.  
✔ **User-Friendly Interface** - Allows users to interactively:  
  - Add cities  
  - Add flight routes  
  - Find the shortest flight path  
  - Book tickets  
✔ **Efficient Performance** - Utilizes **priority queues** for optimized shortest-path calculations.
